Script "electrochemical_plotting.py" used for user specific information, such as folder and file path, and plotting specifics.
"Functions.py" contains all functions used in the other script. 

Script and functions must be placed in the same folder to run. 

I'm hoping that others can be inspired by the script and furhter develop it to their needs. 

For additonal functionalities, please see batplot (developed by Tian Dai). Can be installed through a terminal using pip install batplot

Please don't hesitate to reach out to Amalie for additional capabilities
