Script "electrochemical_plotting.py" used for user specific information, such as folder and file path, and plotting specifics.
"Functions.py" contains all functions used in the other script. 

Script and functions must be placed in the same folder to run. 

I'm hoping that others can be inspired by the script and furhter develop it to their needs.
